## Key Features
1. **Single Codebase**: All components (UI, business logic, data access) are part of one project.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Components are highly dependent on each other, making changes riskier.
3. **Simple Deployment**: The entire application is deployed as a single unit.
4. **Centralized Database**: Typically uses a single database for all data storage and access.


## When to Use
1. **Small to Medium Projects**: Ideal for applications with limited complexity and scope.
2. **Rapid Development**: Suitable for projects requiring quick development and deployment.
3. **Small Teams**: Works well for small teams with limited resources.
4. **Low Scalability Needs**: Best for applications with predictable and low traffic.


## Challenges
- Harder to maintain as the codebase grows.
- Limited scalability (scaling requires scaling the entire application).
- Difficult to adopt new technologies incrementally.


## The Domain And Bounded Context

- `Identity`: The Identity is a bounded context for the authentication and authorization of users using [Identity Server](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer). This service is responsible for creating new users and their corresponding roles and permissions using [.Net Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) and Jwt authentication and authorization.

- `Flight`: The Flight is a bounded context `CRUD` service to handle flight related operations.

- `Passenger`: The Passenger is a bounded context for managing passenger information, tracking activities and subscribing to get notification for out of stock products.

- `Booking`: The Booking is a bounded context for managing all operation related to booking ticket.

## Structure of Project

In this project, I used [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) at the architectural level and [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) to structure my files.

I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many "layers" in an application. We are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. We `minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/vertical-slice-architecture.png" />
</div>

Instead of grouping related action methods in one controller, as found in traditional ASP.net controllers, I used the [REPR pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern). Each action gets its own small endpoint, consisting of a route, the action, and an `IMediator` instance (see [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)). The request is passed to the `IMediator` instance, routed through a [`Mediatr pipeline`](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) where custom [middleware](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) can log, validate and intercept requests. The request is then handled by a request specific `IRequestHandler` which performs business logic before returning the result.

The use of the [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) in my controllers creates clean and [thin controllers](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/). By separating action logic into individual handlers we support the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), this is because traditional controllers tend to become bloated with large action methods and several injected `Services` only being used by a few methods.

I used CQRS to decompose my features into small parts that makes our application:

- Maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- Easy to maintain and add features to. Changes only affect one command or query, avoiding breaking changes or creating side effects.
- It gives us better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines), instead of bloated service classes doing many things.

Using the CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into vertical slices, for each of these slices we group classes (see [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders)) specific to that feature together (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, etc). In our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.


## Development Setup

### Dotnet Tools Packages
For installing our requirement packages with .NET cli tools, we need to install `dotnet tool manifest`.
```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
```
And after that we can restore our dotnet tools packages with .NET cli tools from `.config` folder and `dotnet-tools.json` file.
```
dotnet tool restore
```

### Husky
Here we use `husky` to handel some pre commit rules and we used `conventional commits` rules and `formatting` as pre commit rules, here in [package.json](./package.json). of course, we can add more rules for pre commit in future. (find more about husky in the [documentation](https://typicode.github.io/husky/get-started.html))
We need to install `husky` package for `manage` `pre commits hooks` and also I add two packages `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional` for handling conventional commits rules in [package.json](.././package.json).
Run the command bellow in the root of project to install all npm dependencies related to husky:

```bash
npm install
```

> Note: In the root of project we have `.husky` folder and it has `commit-msg` file for handling conventional commits rules with provide user friendly message and `pre-commit` file that we can run our `scripts` as a `pre-commit` hooks. that here we call `format` script from [package.json](./package.json) for formatting purpose.

### Upgrade Nuget Packages
For upgrading our nuget packages to last version, we use the great package [dotnet-outdated](https://github.com/dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated).
Run the command below in the root of project to upgrade all of packages to last version:
```bash
dotnet outdated -u
```

## How to Run

> ### Config Certificate
Run the following commands to [Config SSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/docker-compose-https?view=aspnetcore-6.0) in your system:

#### Windows using Linux containers
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p password
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```
***Note:** for running this command in `powershell` use `$env:USERPROFILE` instead of `%USERPROFILE%`*

#### macOS or Linux
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```
> ### Docker Compose


To run this app in `Docker`, use the [docker-compose.yaml](./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) and execute the below command at the `root` of the application:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

> ### Build
To `build` monolith app, run this command in the `root` of the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```

> ### Run
To `run` monolith app, run this command in the root of the `Api` folder:
```bash
dotnet run
```

> ### Test

To `test` monolith app, run this command in the `root` of the project:
```bash
dotnet test
```

> ### Documentation Apis

For checking `API documentation`, navigate to `/swagger` for `Swagger OpenAPI` or `/scalar/v1` for `Scalar OpenAPI` to visit list of endpoints.

As part of API testing, I created the [booking.rest](./booking.rest) file which can be run with the [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) `VSCode plugin`.
